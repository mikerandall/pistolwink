            <h2>Build Interactive Stories</h2>

            <p>This project allows users to build interactive stories, keeping track of recurring characters and their connections to different narratives.</p>

            <p>A good example of this would be the UFO community, where characters have connections to multiple narratives, in varying degrees of involvement.</p>
